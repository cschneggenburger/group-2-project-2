# English Premier League Match Results Prediction Model
## Introduction
> This project leverages machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to predict EPL match results (wins, losses, and draws) based on historical match data, team stats, and other factors. This code is intended for sports analysts, EPL fans seeking to gain insights into match outcomes and team performance, and other data scientists exploring the application of machine learning in sports analytics and predictive modeling. 

 Please note: This model is not intended to influence betting behaviors. Any use of the model for such purposes is entirely at the user's discretion and risk.

## Key Features
 - **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to predict match outcomes accurately.

 - **Feature Engineering:** The Project incorporates feature engineering techniques, including missing value imputation, datetime features, and feature interactions, to enhance the predictive effectiveness of the models. 

 - **Evaluation Metrics:** The models' performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 - **Data Preprocessing:** The data set undergoes several preprocessing methodologies to clean, normalize, and transform it in preparation for modeling.

 - **External Factors:** External factors, including weather conditions, player injuries, and other team dynamics, were not used in the current models but are planned for future iterations.

## Data Collection
 The data was pulled from "https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League_Stats" using Python's BeautifulSoup web scraper. The scraped data is stored in the following files:



### Features

These features were identified and grouped in order of importance.
